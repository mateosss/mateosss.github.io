  While the previous update gave me a bird's eye overview of some of the topics
  I wanted to learn more about, these two weeks have been more about getting a
  closer look at the source code of Monado while making a keyboard and mouse
  driver for it.
brief: Reading and making a driver for Monado.

## Complementing the OpenXR Specification

I started reading the Monado [source code][monado-repo] without any particular
objective in mind but now I'm very glad I did so at this stage. Reading an
OpenXR implementation seems to complement nicely the read of the
[specification][oxr-spec] as I had knowledge gaps between the need for some
OpenXR ideas and their applications in VR. When reading the code that makes up
these concepts, I got to know the *how*, which in turn made the re-read of the
specification's *what* make a lot more sense.

An example of this are [`XrSpace`s][oxr-spaces]. Reading the code you will find
a [`xrt_space_relation`][xrt_space_relation] type which has a definition along
the lines of:

```cpp
struct xrt_space_relation {
  struct vec3 position;
  struct quat orientation;
  struct vec3 linear_velocity;
  struct vec3 angular_velocity;
};
```

There is also a so called `xrt_space_graph` container of a sequence of
`xrt_space_relation`s which lets you "chain" spaces together. With this context
alone it becomes a lot more clear that the concept of an `XrSpace` is trying to
mimic the idea of an [inertial frame of reference][ifr-wikipedia] (*though with
[rotations][rrf-wikipedia]*) which can be chained together as well. And while
this idea can be extracted from the [`Spaces`][oxr-spaces-chapter] chapter of
the specification, it might be a bit obfuscated with the API details (*even
though they are quite important for completeness and for using the spec as
reference once you are doing your project*).

## Monado Source

To get a picture of the size of Monado, its `src/` directory as of today has
about 200 KLOC (*with `src/external/` having about 80 KLOC*). That size means it
is not too overwhelming to get a good understanding of most of its parts and
that you may even read it from the start of one of its
[target's][monado-targets] `main` functions and be able to follow along.

I started by reading the `probe` option of the [`cli`][monado-cli] target and
doing a driver that prints to the console. A good start for writing one is
reading `target_lists.c` and the `dummy` driver. In the process, you will find
how a form of inheritance is implemented by some structs usage of a `base`
member. An example of this is how almost all drivers implement a custom struct
that derives from `xrt_device`.

It was useful to have some background in the OpenXR specification as many
functions exposed in Monado base structs are directly related to OpenXR ones
like `xrt_device->get_tracked_pose` with `XrLocateSpace` and
`xrt_device->get_view_pose` with `XrLocateViews`.

As Monado can work both embedded into an app or as a service hosting multiple
OpenXR apps, there is an IPC protocol implemented. Down one of the
call-stack-rabbit-holes, I found references to functions that supposedly did not
exist in the codebase and later found only existed in the `build/` directory. It
was most interesting to find out that this IPC protocol seems to be described in
a [json file][monado-ipc-json] and that a [python script][monado-ipc-py] is
responsible for writing C files which in turn are the ones that manage the
protocol. I've not seen this kind of metaprogramming in other C projects and I
think it is a clever idea considering how frequently an internal IPC protocol
may change. Though I wonder how this compares to other solutions using things
like gRPC, protobuf, thrift, etc.

## Qwerty Driver

I tried to expand my "Hello World" driver into something that did a bit more. As
it seemed to be no easy way to emulate HMDs or controllers with keyboard and
mouse, I thought it could be a good idea to try to do a driver named `qwerty`
which does that. I forked the repo and started working on [it][qwerty]. Here is
a video of the driver in action some days ago:

<div class="youtube-video"><iframe
  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen
  src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5PFXiaS8C6k"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
></iframe></div>

Some more improvements have been implemented after the video was made, the
controllers are now "parented" to the HMD, their poses can be reset, and the
movement speed of each device can be changed at runtime with the mouse wheel.

As my original goal was to have an excuse to read more of Monado, the code was
at first not properly documented, and my commits scattered `XXX` and `TODO`
comments over the entire source code as notes for my future self. However, once
I shared it in the Monado Discord I saw that some people might want the feature
implemented. Also, it would be pretty nice to have this driver complement
physical devices as well. I will try to eventually get it merged after I solve
some problems. In fact, a solution to one of the first problems was merged today
and it was my [first contribution][first-contrib] to Monado!

There were other problems that took some time to solve when first implementing
the driver:

- How to even grab inputs from the keyboard and mouse. Two windows that Monado
  can open are the debug UI which uses SDL and ImGui and the compositor window
  which uses Vulkan and XCB. I ended up choosing the debug UI because I thought
  it would be easier to work with. And indeed, SDL events are very
  straightforward, however, I don't like the fact that I'm building over
  procedures prefixed with `oxr_sdl2_hack_*` (*note the **`hack`** in there*).

- Figuring out meson dependencies.

- Things that were not yet implemented in Monado and that I wasn't sure were my
  fault. The Discord [server][monado-discord] was very helpful for that.

- Dealing directly with quaternions for once. I usually used them through game
  engine abstractions, and while Monado has some of those abstractions, I had a
  knowledge debt with myself in that regard. Long story short, I really liked
  [this book][book-graphics-math]. It presents the information in a standard
  *definition-theorem-proof* way for math concepts related to graphics. I will
  take the time to read more of its chapters in the future. Another nice
  resource, though less "to the point", are the amazing 3Blue1Brown
  [videos][3b1b-video] and [explorable explanation][3b1b-page] (*see also a
  [list][explorables] of other explorable explanations if you don't care losing
  some hours*).

## SLAM Introductory Papers

I did some introductory reads of SLAM, in particular, I started with this
[paper][slam-overview] which seemed like a good overview of SLAM with the hopes
of understanding some of it. Before diving into the main topics, the paper
recommended for non-expert readers, to get a look at [these][slam-tutorial-1]
[tutorials][slam-tutorial-2]. And so I ended up reading the first one.
Unfortunately, while the problem setup uses basic probability and statistics
concepts, the main section, *"Solutions to the SLAM Problem"* went way over my
head, as I don't have knowledge about Kalman filters nor in the Rao-Blackwell
theorem. Even considering this, I got a better understanding of the problem SLAM
faces, and how probabilistic approaches seem to be the standard (*though I'm
also excited to see how well new techniques using deep learning perform at
SLAM*).

## What's Next

The next two weeks are my last before starting classes again, so I'll probably
use some of this time to finish non-XR stuff I've been delaying. Having said so,
I would like to move forward with the Qwerty driver and get it merged.

Besides that, I still have a lot to cover, and might pick to do something
related to one of these:

- SLAM: There are two routes I want to explore, one is the theoretical one,
  learning about Kalman filters would probably be a good start for that. The
  other one would be to find some premade library and try to implement something
  with standard datasets.

- Graphics Theory: The math book mentioned above seems to have many great
  chapters, I'm very interested in better understanding 3D transformations, and
  so the Transforms chapter would make a nice read.

- Graphics APIs: I will forget about Vulkan for now, as everywhere I see, it is
  recommended to start with OpenGL, and so it may be interesting to follow
  something like <https://learnopengl.com/>.

- VR: At first I did not consider VR as something separated from graphics, but
  the more I read Monado and XR related articles, the more I understand that the
  combination of problems facing this medium is very unique, and so it may be
  good to read something that focuses on those. I initially found
  [this][vr-book] book, but might look for other options as well if I decide to
  go down this path.
